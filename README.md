# hijridates
Hijri Dates converted to HTML JAVSCRIPT CSS , from an image input from an existing calendar , using AI, google gemini 2.5

#installation
No complicated installation

But it loads the miqaats json file

So it has to be hosted on a local webserver
or a public webserver like netlify
or even github pages

It will not run directly from folder

Or you can modify to code
to integrate miqaats within the javascript itself
